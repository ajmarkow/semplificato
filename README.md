## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

- A Rails/Ruby App which enables you to manage snippets (for your text expander program Espanso in the cloud) with a React Front-End.
- Snippets are key value pairs, where upon typing the key is replaced with the value.
  - For Example, I type THE snippet :yolo and my text expander program automatically fills the phrase “you only live once”.
